### Conway's Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a zero-player cellular automaton game

- [conway.py](python/conway.py)

The game is randomly generated each time. Some games will be over very quickly, others will last a few generations. Press `Ctrl + C` to quit and then run it again.

(( Additions by Jarvist to auto-restart the population if it's reached steady-state, and pick random colours. ))
